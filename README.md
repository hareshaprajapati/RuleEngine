This project is useful to evaluate any expression like "( ADMISSION_TYPE = 3.0 OR NOT PATIENT_TYPE IN ( 'A B' , 'C D' ) OR NOT INTVALUE IN ( 2 , 3 )  )" by passing variable(ADMISSION_TYPE,PATIENT_TYPE,INTVALUE) value in map. It will evaluate the expression by checking variable value from map and will return true or false. Just run main class to see the output and how easy to evaluate such expression.
